IN PROGRESS:

-   Create an Entertainer from Registering a User
    -   Entertainer needs to extend from User
        -   When user selects "Register"
        -   Need to be able to select if user is an ENTERTAINER OR NOT - IN PROGRESS - USING **kwargs
            -   Create normal User
            -   Log the user in
            -   if is_entertainer == True
                -   register as Entertainer in entertainers app
                -   form = EntertainerRegistrationForm(request.POST)
                -   form.user = User (Currently logged in user)
                -   form.save()
        -   Instead of using One to One Relationship the model could use   entertainer.user = models.ForeignKey(user)
